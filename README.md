note to self: don't forget to commit changes!

To run programs in go, make sure you're in the correct directory (use cd command).
Compile the program by using the command "go build"
In a command line for windows, just state the file name, but in VS Code, put "./" and then the file name to run the executable file.
For mac, always put "./" before the file name to run the executable file.
